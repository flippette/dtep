it is the simplest, and therefore best, prose composition tool.

I started the Digital Thinking and Electronics Prototyping course this week.
I don't know what I was thinking, enrolling in Digital Systems and **Design**
and expecting for there not to be any **design** classes, but alas, I was wrong.
I've had a bad impression of arts and design ever since I was removed from an
arts class in primary school for barely progressing at all, and ever since I've
been a strictly technical person. However, this course feels different for me,
for before now I have yet to consider the importance of good design in the making
of electronic products, a field I've hitherto viewed as rigid and far removed
from the average person.

As I was introduced to the course syllabus during the lecture, I saw both the
typical electronics and programming content that I had expected, and also new
things that I have wanted to try for a while, especially 3D modelling and
printing. After that, I was briefed on the project that this course will lead
me to complete: a working electronic measuring device, made with a user-centric
design process. For all my years programming and building electronics, I had
never attempted to build something for people to use, but rather only focused
on solving a specific problem that I had in my daily life. This project is well
beyond my comfort zone, but surely that will turn me into a better maker.

A pretty significant part of this course seems to be centered around the
learning diary: a weekly self-reflection on my experience throughout the course.
I've always really struggled with writing; not because of language capabilities,
but rather because I'd never paid enough attention to my surroundings to make
sufficiently interesting observations to write about. Despite my knee-jerk
reaction of intensely disliking this kind of assignment, I know that it will
at least motivate me to be more sensitive to my surroundings, and gain depth in
my personality.

The course book I was introduced during the first lecture, _The Design of
Everyday Things_ by Donald A. Norman[^tdet], has opened my eyes to the
challenges of designing things for humans just through the first few chapters.
It has never occurred to me before that a large portion of the frustration people
feel daily is due to poor or unintuitive design, the effects of which can be
catastrophic, yet the blame is still commonly placed on human error. It has been
(so far) a great read, and a profound message for makers such as myself.

I also got to meet the team with whom I'll be working on the project with.
All of us seem to be fairly familiar with programming, so we're good on that
front, but our design and communication abilities are a bit of an unknown
quantity for now. I hope we get along well, and also that I don't drag them
down.
